=====

Naavi is an attempt to make nested dropdown menus suck less

How?

Well, it includes hover-intent, practically meaning a user's mouse can leave a nested menu without the menu dissapearing forcing the user to start their navigation journey all over again.




NOTE: the script only aids functionality, it only attaches classes, it does not attach styles
